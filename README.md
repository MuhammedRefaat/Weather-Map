# Weather-Map
## Weather Forecast Application

This Android Application has two different functionalities:
1. Get the weather forecast for your city using your current location and display it for 3hours/5days.
2. Get the current weather condition for 3 to 7 cities by searching using cities names.

Each functionality can be run individually using the proper button in the Home Screen:

### Running App:
- The App code can run using and IDE that supports Android (Android Studio, VS-Code, Exlipse, ...etc).

### Running App Unit Tests:
- The app unit tests as well can run using any IDE.
- The app unit tests can be run separately like regular Kotlin class, no need to run the app itself.
- Each unit test class can run separately, and every function of the class can run separately.
- The test code coverage report can run along with the unit test execution (e.g in Android Studio you select "Run <class-name> with Coverage" instead of "Run <class-name>).
  
### Installing App on Android Devices:
- The app can be installed in Android Devices using one of two ways:
    1. run the code directly from the IDE to the connected device after selecting the device as the target device (USB Debugging should be [enabled from device settings](https://www.embarcadero.com/starthere/xe5/mobdevsetup/android/en/enabling_usb_debugging_on_an_android_device.html))
    2. use the IDE to generate app APK and install that executable apk on the device after transferring it to the device
